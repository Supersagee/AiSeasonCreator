***AiSeasonCreator***

The purpose of this program is to create AI seasons and rosters based on the iRacing multiplayer seasons, along with editing existing user rosters with minimal effort.

The AI seasons that are created will contain the proper tracks, cars, time/laps, etc. in order to match the multiplayer series.

Keep in mind that some cars and tracks are not AI enabled.
