***AiSeasonCreator***

The purpose of this program is to create AI seasons based on the the iRacing multiplayer seasons with minimal effort.

The seasons created based on the the series that is chosen will contain the proper tracks, cars, time/laps, etc. in 
order to match the multiplayer series.

Keep in mind that some cars and tracks are not AI enabled.

If a multiclass series is created, such as IMSA, Production Car Challenge, etc., you will need 
to open iRacing and go to "Opponent Rosters" under the AI Racing tab and click on the newly created roster. 
Click "Save Edits" at the bottom right to set AI driver attributes.
